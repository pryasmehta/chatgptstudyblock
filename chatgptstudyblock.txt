website visited with different devices 
Websites can be visited with different devices, including computers, smartphones, tablets, and other internet-connected devices. When a website is accessed from different devices, it may be displayed differently depending on the screen size and other device-specific factors.

To ensure that a website looks good and functions well on various devices, it is important to design it to be responsive. Responsive design means that the website will adapt to the screen size and other features of the device on which it is being viewed. This can involve using flexible layouts, images, and other elements that can resize and reposition themselves based on the size of the screen.

Some ways to test how a website appears on different devices include using emulators and simulators that replicate the experience of using the website on different devices. It is also important to test the website on real devices, if possible, to get a better sense of how it looks and functions in the real world.
